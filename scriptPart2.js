// Part 2: Expanding Functionality

/*
Declare a variable that stores the number of columns in each row
 of data within the CSV.
Instead of hard-coding four columns per row, 
expand your code to accept any number of columns. 
This should be calculated dynamically based on the first row of data.
For example, if the first row of data (the headings) has eight entries,
 your program should create eight entries per row. 
 You can safely assume that all rows that follow 
 will contain the same number of entries per row.
After you have implemented the above:
Store your results in a two-dimensional array.
Each row should be its own array, with individual entries for each column.
Each row should be stored in a parent array, 
with the heading row located at index 0.
Cache this two-dimensional array in a variable for later use.
